I am a computer science student specializing in **Artificial Intelligence** & **Data Science**, and **Research** at EPITA. On this profile, you can view my current projects and past achievements in these fields. (As I am still student and the project are still going through, only the finished one are currently available.)

You can see my contributions to project that I do not possess in my *star* section in the *contribution* list

I am also a research student at LRE (Research Laboratory of EPITA). My work is focusing on **line detection** using multiple object tracking (without deep learning) approach in **document images**.

The following list includes my contributions in my research project:
- Creation of a modulable pipeline (C++) for line detection in document using multiple object tracking
- Improvement of the evaluation for line detection (Python)

The Open-Source scribo pipeline is available in the scribo folder of https://gitlab.lre.epita.fr/olena/pylene repository and a play ground is available ![here](https://github.com/Sefray/RDI2023-Seminar).
